# Kosu-Graph ðŸŒ½

Kosu-Graph is a graph system specifically designed for maze mapping and intelligent path finding. It empowers robots to navigate complex mazes efficiently.

## Key Features âœ¨

* **Optimal Pathfinding:** Kosu-Graph determines the best path for your robot to explore the labyrinth, taking into account both distance and maneuverability.
* **Customizable A\* Search:** This implementation of the A* algorithm incorporates a unique feature.
* **Comprehensive Edge Management:** You can effortlessly add, modify the weight of, and remove edges within the graph, providing fine-grained control over the maze representation.
* **Visualization Tools:** Kosu-Graph offers methods to print the maze in various formats, including displaying the robot's current position or highlighting the calculated path. This visualization aids in debugging and understanding the robot's decision-making process.

## Designed for RoboCup ðŸ¤–

This project was developed specifically for RoboCup's Rescue Maze competition, where robots navigate an unknown maze with the following characteristics:

* Multi-level structure with obstacles.
* Areas with varying difficulty levels.
* Zones containing blocks that significantly impede progress if not traversed strategically.

### Kosu-Graph's Implementation for the Competition

See Kosu-Graph's implementation for RoboCup's Rescue Maze competition: [robot-v2](https://github.com/Dave879/robot-v2). This repository showcases how Kosu-Graph was adapted to the specific requirements of the competition.

## ðŸš§ Getting Started ðŸš§

**(Please note: Specific instructions on project setup and usage will be added in a future update)**

I am actively working on providing detailed instructions to guide you through setting up and using Kosu-Graph. This documentation will be incorporated into this readme.md shortly.

In the meantime, feel free to explore the codebase and experiment with the functionalities offered by Kosu-Graph. I welcome your contributions and suggestions!
